simple backup:

c# backup: save error log same as template xml file
------------------



full / incremental / differntial -> 3 classes per create/restore
save latest backups in template

display copy percentage less frequently

---

optional:
- name input when creating
- save notes at backup: textbox -> if not empty -> info.txt

BrowseFileOrFolder (copying single files)
seems to be wrong
alternative: 2 buttons folders/files

restoring of incremental backup:
save previous full backup path and date, restore oldest to newest

template:
GetFilterForDirectory

try excluding empty folders / deleting them after backup
